### Project Title
Explore Bike Share Data

### Description
For this project, your goal is to ask and answer three questions about the available bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York. This notebook can be submitted directly through the workspace when you are confident in your results.

### Files used
The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year
The original files are much larger and messier, and you don’t need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you’d like to see them (Chicago, New York City, Washington). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some data wrangling has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns.

### Credits
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful while I was pursuing this project.
